Here is an **informative guide** detailing the **formula, working mechanism, and uses** of various **Machine Learning algorithms** categorized into **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Gradient Boosting** methods:

---

## **Supervised Learning Algorithms**

## **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**

### **1. K-Means Clustering**

  - \(S_k\): Data points in cluster \(k\)  

- **Use**: Customer segmentation, image compression.  
- **Working**: Iteratively assigns points to the nearest centroid and updates centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance.

---

### **2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**
- **Formula**:  
  Minimum points density condition:
  \[
  N_{\epsilon}(p) \geq \text{MinPts}
  \]
  - \(N_{\epsilon}(p)\): Neighborhood of point \(p\) within radius \(\epsilon\)  

- **Use**: Anomaly detection, geospatial data analysis.  
- **Working**: Groups points into dense regions and labels sparse points as noise.

---

## **Gradient Boosting Algorithms**

### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Formula**:  
  Eigenvalue decomposition:
  \[
  Cov(X) = Q \Lambda Q^{-1}
  \]
  - \(Cov(X)\): Covariance matrix  
  - \(Q\): Eigenvectors  
  - \(\Lambda\): Eigenvalues  

- **Use**: Dimensionality reduction, feature extraction.  
- **Working**: Projects data into lower dimensions by retaining the components with the highest variance.

---

### **2. Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Formula**:  
  Dendrogram linkage:
  \[
  d(A, B) = \min_{i \in A, j \in B} d(i, j)
  \]
  - \(A, B\): Clusters  
  - \(d(i, j)\): Distance between points \(i\) and \(j\)  

- **Use**: Gene expression analysis, document clustering.  
- **Working**: Iteratively merges clusters based on their similarity.

---

### **3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
- **Formula**:  
  Update rule:
  \[
  F_{m+1}(x) = F_m(x) + \gamma h_m(x)

  - \(h_m(x)\): Weak learner  

- **Use**: Risk modeling, sales forecasting.  
- **Working**: Adds weak learners iteratively to minimize a loss function.

### **4. XGBoost**
- **Formula**:  
  Objective function:
  \[
  Obj = \sum_{i} l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k} \Omega(h_k)
  \]
  - \(l\): Loss function  
  - \(\Omega\): Regularization term

### **5. LightGBM**

  Leaf-wise growth:
  \[
  Gain = \frac{(sumGrad)^2}{countGrad + \lambda}
  \]
  
- **Use**: Large datasets, quick training.  
- **Working**: Splits trees leaf-wise instead of level-wise for better performance.

  \[
  Target Encoding: TE(x) = \frac{\sum y}{\text{Count of } x}
  \]
