2. Basic Syntax

2.1 R as a Calculator

R can perform basic arithmetic calculations:

# Basic operations
2 + 3    # Addition
7 - 4    # Subtraction
6 * 3    # Multiplication
8 / 2    # Division
5 ^ 2    # Exponentiation
10 %% 3  # Modulo (remainder)

2.2 Variables

You can store data in variables for later use:

x <- 5    # Assign 5 to variable x
y <- 10   # Assign 10 to variable y

# Display variables
x
y

2.3 Comments

Comments in R are made with #:

# This is a comment


---

3. Data Types

3.1 Numeric, Integer, and Logical Types

# Numeric
num <- 12.5
is.numeric(num)

# Integer
int <- 5L  # The 'L' tells R to store it as an integer
is.integer(int)

# Logical
bool <- TRUE
is.logical(bool)

3.2 Character Strings

str <- "Hello, R!"
is.character(str)


---

4. Data Structures in R

4.1 Vectors

Vectors are sequences of data elements of the same basic type.

# Create a numeric vector
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
v

# Access elements
v[2]  # Returns the second element

# Operations on vectors
v + 2  # Adds 2 to each element in the vector

4.2 Matrices

Matrices are two-dimensional arrays.

# Create a 2x3 matrix
m <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m

# Access elements
m[1, 2]  # Element in the first row, second column

4.3 Data Frames

Data frames are like tables in R where each column can contain different types of data.

# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(Name = c("John", "Sara"),
                 Age = c(25, 30),
                 Gender = c("M", "F"))
df

# Access columns and rows
df$Name  # Access Name column
df[1, ]  # Access the first row

4.4 Lists

Lists can contain different types of objects.

# Create a list
lst <- list(Name = "John", Age = 25, Scores = c(90, 85, 88))
lst

# Access elements
lst$Scores  # Access Scores element


---

5. Control Structures

5.1 If-Else Statements

x <- 5
if (x > 3) {
  print("x is greater than 3")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 3")
}

5.2 For Loop

for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

5.3 While Loop

x <- 1
while (x <= 5) {
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
}


---

6. Functions

R allows you to write your own functions.

# Define a function
add_numbers <- function(a, b) {
  return(a + b)
}

# Call the function
add_numbers(5, 10)


---

7. Apply Functions

R provides various "apply" functions that allow you to apply a function to elements of a data structure.

7.1 lapply()

Applies a function to each element of a list.

lst <- list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
lapply(lst, mean)

7.2 sapply()

Similar to lapply() but returns a simplified result (e.g., a vector or matrix).

sapply(lst, mean)


---

8. Reading and Writing Data

8.1 Reading from a CSV File

data <- read.csv("data.csv")
head(data)  # Display the first few rows

8.2 Writing to a CSV File

write.csv(data, "output.csv")


---

9. Plotting and Visualization

R provides powerful visualization tools. The base R plotting functions can be used for simple plots, but libraries like ggplot2 offer advanced visualization capabilities.

9.1 Base Plotting

# Scatter plot
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
plot(x, y, type = "p", col = "blue")

9.2 Using ggplot2

First, install the ggplot2 package:

install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point()


---

10. Packages

10.1 Installing a Package

R has a large collection of packages for various tasks.

# Install a package
install.packages("dplyr")

10.2 Loading a Package

# Load a package
library(dplyr)


---

11. Advanced Topics

11.1 Data Manipulation with dplyr

The dplyr package is a fast and consistent tool for data manipulation.

library(dplyr)

# Filter data
filtered_data <- mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20)

# Select columns
selected_data <- mtcars %>% select(mpg, hp)

11.2 Handling Missing Data

# Check for missing values
is.na(data)

# Remove rows with missing data
clean_data <- na.omit(data)


---

12. Statistical Analysis

R is widely used for statistical analysis. Some common functions include:

12.1 Summary Statistics

# Mean, median, variance
mean(mtcars$mpg)
median(mtcars$hp)
var(mtcars$wt)

12.2 Linear Regression

# Simple linear regression
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)

14. Advanced Data Manipulation

The dplyr and tidyr packages are part of the tidyverse, a collection of packages designed for data science.

14.1 Pipelines (%>%) with dplyr

The %>% operator, often called the pipe, is used to pass the output of one function into another.

library(dplyr)

# Example: Filter rows, select columns, and compute the mean of a column
result <- mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl == 6) %>%
  select(mpg, hp) %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
result

14.2 Data Reshaping with tidyr

tidyr is used for data tidying, i.e., converting messy data into a tidy format (where each variable is a column and each observation is a row).

library(tidyr)

# Gather: Reshape wide data into long data
long_data <- pivot_longer(mtcars, cols = mpg:hp, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")
head(long_data)

# Spread: Reshape long data into wide data
wide_data <- pivot_wider(long_data, names_from = variable, values_from = value)
head(wide_data)

14.3 Joining Datasets

You can join multiple data frames using dplyr functions like inner_join, left_join, right_join, and full_join.

data1 <- data.frame(ID = c(1, 2, 3), Score1 = c(90, 85, 88))
data2 <- data.frame(ID = c(1, 2, 4), Score2 = c(75, 80, 70))

# Perform left join
joined_data <- left_join(data1, data2, by = "ID")
joined_data


---

15. Statistical Modeling and Hypothesis Testing

15.1 t-Test

A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups.

# Perform a t-test
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)  # mpg by transmission type (am)

15.2 Chi-Square Test

A chi-square test is used to test the independence of two categorical variables.

# Create a contingency table
table <- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am)

# Perform chi-square test
chisq.test(table)

15.3 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

ANOVA tests if the means of several groups are equal.

# One-way ANOVA
anova_model <- aov(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(anova_model)

15.4 Linear Regression

Linear regression models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

# Simple linear regression
model <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)

# Plot regression line
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg)
abline(model)

15.5 Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical.

# Logistic regression example
logistic_model <- glm(am ~ mpg + hp, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
summary(logistic_model)

16. Machine Learning with R

R is equipped with powerful machine learning libraries such as caret, randomForest, and e1071. Here's an overview of some machine learning techniques.

16.1 Classification with Decision Trees

# Load required library
library(rpart)

# Train a decision tree model
tree_model <- rpart(Species ~ ., data = iris)

# Plot the tree
plot(tree_model)
text(tree_model, use.n = TRUE)

16.2 Random Forest

Random forest is an ensemble method that grows many decision trees and combines them.

library(randomForest)

# Train a random forest model
rf_model <- randomForest(Species ~ ., data = iris)
print(rf_model)

16.3 K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is used for unsupervised learning to group similar data points.

# Perform K-means clustering
set.seed(123)
kmeans_model <- kmeans(iris[, 1:4], centers = 3)
kmeans_model$centers

# Plot clusters
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, color = factor(kmeans_model$cluster))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "K-Means Clustering")

16.4 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models used for classification and regression.

library(e1071)

# Train an SVM model
svm_model <- svm(Species ~ ., data = iris)
summary(svm_model)


---

17. Working with Big Data

17.1 Handling Large Datasets with data.table

The data.table package is optimized for large datasets.

library(data.table)

# Load data
dt <- fread("large_dataset.csv")

# View first few rows
head(dt)

# Filter and summarize data
filtered_dt <- dt[age > 30, .(avg_income = mean(income)), by = gender]

17.2 Parallel Computing with R

Parallel computing helps improve the efficiency of code by running operations simultaneously on multiple processors.

library(parallel)

# Number of available cores
no_cores <- detectCores() - 1

# Parallel apply using mclapply
result <- mclapply(1:10, function(x) x^2, mc.cores = no_cores)


---

18. Time Series Analysis

18.1 Plotting Time Series Data

# Load the built-in AirPassengers dataset
data(AirPassengers)

# Plot the time series
plot(AirPassengers, main = "AirPassengers Data", ylab = "Passengers", xlab = "Time")

18.2 Decomposing Time Series

You can decompose a time series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components.

# Decompose the time series
decomposed <- decompose(AirPassengers)
plot(decomposed)

18.3 ARIMA Models

ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular model for time series forecasting.

library(forecast)

# Fit ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(AirPassengers)

# Forecast the next 12 periods
forecasted <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)
plot(forecasted)
